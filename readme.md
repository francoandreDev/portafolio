## About me

### About the features

- **Themes:** Themes are applied to the body via a custom attribute called `theme-name`. The values are defined in `Themes.js` and `styles.css` within the themes layer. A click event on the button is detected using an event listener in `main.js`.

- **Translations:** Translations are applied to elements with the custom attribute `translate-element`. The values are defined in `Translator.js` as a dictionary, where the first entry is the language and the second is the element ID to translate. A click event on the button is detected using an event listener in `main.js`.
